                            <h2> Study Tips </h2>
                            <h3>Keep a calendar</h3>
                            <p>Create your own calendar, physical or digital, where you can enter all of your schduled
                                class times, due dates for asignments and exams, and schedule in blocks of study time.
                                Set yourself up
                                for success! By scheduling in every course milestone, you already have an idea of
                                direction the course
                                material is headed, and you can stay on track throughout the semester. By scheduling in
                                study time, you
                                can develop a routine so that studying happens naturally and you can hold yourself more
                                accountable in
                                getting your work done.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Don't Forget to Take Breaks (but Don't get Carried Away)</h3>
                            <p>Taking 5 - 10 minute breaks during a study session
                                is a great way to stay on task for longer periods of time without becoming mentally
                                exhausted. Taking a
                                short walk, stretching, even a short meditation can actually help you to be more focused
                                when you return,
                                just make sure that break time isn't suddenly stretching over 2 hours.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Stay Hydrated</h3>
                            <p>Water is life. Make sure you're drinking lots of water throughout to maintain good health
                                and stay clear headed.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Study with Friends</h3>
                            <p>Join or even start a study group with classmates. Collaborating with other people is
                                a great way to see things from new perspectives. Study groups can help keep each other
                                accountable
                                during group study sessions and remind each other of upcoming due dates to stay on
                                track.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Write Notes</h3>
                            <p>Keeping digital notes is great if you have a laptop or
                                some other device you can take to class, but writing out a second set of handwritten
                                notes is an excellent
                                way to reprocess information that may have been delivered quickly during a lecture and
                                reorganizating the
                                information in a way that makes better sense for you. Feel free to get creative! Add
                                colour using
                                highlighters, make a deck of cue cards, create diagrams; find the best way for you to
                                digest the information.

                            <h3>Don't Ignore Your Personal Needs</h3>
                            <p>It's easy to lose yourself in the study grind, but don't forget to put
                                aside time for your personal life. Burnout is very real, and while it may seem
                                counter-productive to take
                                time for yourself, you'll come back refreshed and renergized!
                            </p>
                            <h3>Get Organized</h3>
                            <p>If you followed our studying advice then you've already got a calendar filled in with
                                your
                                study schedule. Now you know exactly when you can set aside time for yourself, your
                                family, and your
                                friends. Planning ahead is going to be one of the best ways to make sure that you have
                                time set aside from
                                your schoolwork for whatever you need.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Keep Active</h3>
                            <p>Physical activity has many benefits for your mental health as well as your physical
                                health.
                                Make sure to set aside some time every week for your favorite physical activity
                                (:eyes:).
                            </p>
                            <h3>Get Outside</h3>
                            <p>Whether during your free time or if you want to study outdoors, fresh air will help to
                                reinvigorate your soul.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Check out Meditation</h3>
                            <p>Meditation is a great way to ease your mind and find some personal escape.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Check-in with Yourself</h3>
                            <p>School can get overwhelming even without the added stressors of your personal life.
                                Make sure you are consistenly checking in with yourself and addressing any excessive
                                anxiety or negative
                                thoughts. Identifying a problem is always the first step in resolving anything.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Don't Forget to Have Fun</h3>
                            <p>Make you are setting aside even a little time to do the things that you love. Keeping
                                up with your hobbies is still important, even when your neck-deep in due dates.

                            <p>University is hard. Life is hard. Everybody needs help sometimes. Don't ever feel like
